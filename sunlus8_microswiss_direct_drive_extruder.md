This document include my notes on upgrading a Sunlu-S8 (CR10 clone) to use the MicroSwiss direct drive [extruder kit](https://store.micro-swiss.com/collections/extruders/products/micro-swiss-direct-drive-extruder) with a the all [metal hotend](https://store.micro-swiss.com/collections/all-metal-hotend-kits/products/all-metal-hotend-kit-for-cr-10).
