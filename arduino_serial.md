## Serial 1 ##

Serial 1 is the USB port of the board.


## Serials ##

| BOARD | PORT | RX | TX |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| MEGA | D | 19 | 18 |
| UNO | D | 0 | 1 |


## Set the direction register ##

```c
// set pins 8..13 as output...
DDRB = B00111111;  // digital pins -,-,13,12,11,10,9,8
        
DDRB |= B00000100;        //Sets D10 as OUTPUT
DDRB &= B00000100;
```

```c
// Write simultaneously to pins 8..13...
PORTB = B00111000;   // turns on 13,12,11; turns off 10,9,8
```        

## SPI ##

![SPI NETWORK](image.png)

Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is a synchronous serial data protocol used by Microcontrollers for communicating with one or more peripheral devices quickly over short distances. It can also be used for communication between two microcontrollers.

The SPI bus refers to the wires that connect the master device to the slave devices.

Each master and slave device uses 4 pins.

### Master Out Slave In (MOSI, SDI) ###

The connection for the master device to send data to the slave device.

### Master In Slave Out (MISO, SDO) ###

The connection for the slave device to send data back to the master device. Commonly known as *SDO* "Slave Data Out",or *DO* for "Data Out".

### Serial Clock (SCLK, SCL) ### 

The line that carries the clock pulse generated by the master device

### Chip Select ###

Slave Select/Chip Select (SS/CS) is the connection used by the master device to inform the slave device that it will send or request data. The SS/CS pin should be set to LOW to inform the slave that the master will send or request data. Otherwise, it is always HIGH

Each device has its own CS line/pin. When the pin is high the device is not active and when low the device will activate and will send or receive data.

To talk to a particular peripheral, you'll make that peripheral's CS line low and keep the rest of them high.


### Configuration ###

There are several things we need to know about an SPI interface
