**Register Select** (RS, 


## Serial 1 ##

Serial 1 is the USB port of the board.


## Serials ##

| BOARD | PORT | RX | TX |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| MEGA | D | 19 | 18 |
| UNO | D | 0 | 1 |


## Set the direction register ##

```c
// set pins 8..13 as output...
DDRB = B00111111;  // digital pins -,-,13,12,11,10,9,8
        
DDRB |= B00000100;        //Sets D10 as OUTPUT
DDRB &= B00000100;
```

```c
// Write simultaneously to pins 8..13...
PORTB = B00111000;   // turns on 13,12,11; turns off 10,9,8
```        

## SPI ##

![SPI NETWORK](image.png)

The SPI bus refers to the wires that connect the master device to the slave devices. Each master and slave device has the following pins:

Master Out Slave In (MOSI, SDI) – the connection for the master device to send data to the slave device

Master In Slave Out (MISO, SDO) – the connection for the slave device to send data back to the master device

Serial Clock (SCLK, SCL) – the line that carries the clock pulse generated by the master device




### Chip Select ###

Slave Select/Chip Select (SS/CS) – the connection used by the master device to inform the slave device that it will send or request data. The SS/CS pin should be set to LOW to inform the slave that the master will send or request data. Otherwise, it is always HIGH

Each device has its own CS line/pin. When the pin is high the device is not active and when low the device will activate and will send or receive data.

To talk to a particular peripheral, you'll make that peripheral's CS line low and keep the rest of them high.
