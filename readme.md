The R1 is pretty much a traditional RAMPS 1.4 3D printer as such is fairly easy to find parts and hack it.

## Hot End ##

The R1+ comes with a "hexagon hotend".
The nozzle is a 0.4mm for 1.75mm filament, a M6 thread, 1mm thread pitch.
Thermistor is EPCOS 100k ohms, 4.7k pullup. You may use others but must be configured on the firmware.
Heater Cardrige is a 12v/30w. 

Available at [reprapdiscount](http://www.reprapdiscount.com/hotends/67-hexagon-hotend-set.html).

Nozzles compatible with E3D V6 should also work with the stock hexagon hotend as long as its for 1.75mm filament.

## Other Hotends ##

The [filament throats](https://reprap.org/forum/read.php?14,846189,846189) may be full metal or PTFE (teflon) lined.
A general accepted opinion is that PTFE lined throaths limits your tempetures but for most people the range is fine) and may cause jams. For example models HE280, E3D V6 clones may also use PTFE.

When possible stick to all aluminum/metal.
